/**
 * Tests for the `--check` guard in `generate-api-types.ts` (#2586).
 *
 * The contract under test is the decision: stale content is rejected, an
 * equivalent CRLF checkout is not, and check mode leaves the file alone. That
 * decision is exercised in-process against a temp fixture.
 *
 * These used to drive the CLI as a subprocess, which timed out at Bun's 5000 ms
 * default on both ubuntu and windows runners (#2931). The spawn regenerated the
 * types in full to produce a value the test then contradicted by appending to
 * the file: prettier alone was ~1470 ms of it, the openapi-typescript child
 * ~270 ms and loading the route tree ~245 ms, while the comparison being
 * verified took ~3 ms. Regenerating is what `bun run check:api-types` does as
 * its own CI step and in `validate`, so the generator and its exit codes stay
 * covered there; repeating it here bought only the handful of lines that
 * translate the outcome below into a message and `process.exit(2)`.
 *
 * The old shape also mutated the committed `api.generated.d.ts`, restoring it in
 * a `finally` that has to win a race against the timeout it was hitting. Losing
 * that race leaves the file dirty for whatever runs next. A temp fixture removes
 * the question.
