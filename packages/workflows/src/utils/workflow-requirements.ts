 * Workflow capability requirements gate.

 * cost — if the originating user hasn't connected the required capability.
 *
 * This module is pure: callers resolve the runtime connection status (a DB
 * check) and pass it in. The orchestrator/CLI/web entrypoints own the I/O; this
 * just encodes the policy so all three behave identically.

 * (`defaultRunInputs` in executor.ts), so they track the workflow's current YAML instead
 * of freezing a snapshot into the run row, and a bare run persists exactly nothing and so
 * behaves byte-for-byte as it did before this feature. The `workflow:` child path
 * persists the resolved map instead; the effective `$INPUTS` is identical either way
 * because the executor layers defaults *under* whatever the row carries — the difference
