/**
 * A compiled binary's capture has to stand on its own.
 *
 * A binary keeps its bundled workflows, commands, and scripts as embedded constants rather
 * than files. Left that way, a capture could not include them, so a run that statically
 * included a bundled workflow had no way to prove on resume that it had not changed under
 * an Archon upgrade — and the only safe answer was to refuse the resume outright. That
 * refused every paused binary run across every upgrade, whether or not it touched bundled
 * content.
 *
 * Writing the constants into the capture turns an unprovable case into an ordinary digest
 * check. These tests run with `isBinaryBuild()` forced true, because that branch is
 * otherwise unreachable from a source checkout.
 *
 * Own file, own `bun test` invocation: `mock.module` is process-global and irreversible,
 * and pretending to be a binary would poison every other suite in the process.
