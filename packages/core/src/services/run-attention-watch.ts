 * it makes the answer arrive sooner, it is never the answer. That split is forced by
 * evidence: `resolveAndCancelApprovalGate` writes a terminal `cancelled` while
 * inserting only an `approval_received` row, a `child_workflow` pause persists no
 * event at all, and `approval_requested` is written fire-and-forget. An event-derived
 * wake would miss all three.
 *
 * Core owns the capability; a host owns the interval, the deadline, and the lifecycle
 * (the `listDueWorkflowContinuations` / `workflow-resume-service` division). This
 * function performs NO writes: it reads run rows and returns a value.
