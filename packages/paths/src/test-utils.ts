 * The first five are the set Node documents for `rm`'s own `maxRetries`. `EFAULT` is the
 * odd one, and it is not defensive padding — under Bun it is the only entry that does any
 * work. Bun's `rm` maps any underlying OS error it cannot classify onto `EFAULT`, so an
 * ordinary lock arrives wearing a code that reads as a bad pointer. Measured against the
 * probe described below, which induces a genuine `EPERM` with the macOS `uchg` flag and
 * releases it after 300 ms: with `EFAULT` listed the tree is removed after ~310 ms of
 * retrying; with it dropped the same call gives up in 0 ms and leaves the tree on disk,
 * because the `EPERM` never arrives under that name. This is the signature these cleanups
 * fail with on Windows CI (#2306).
 *
 * Because Bun collapses unmapped errors onto `EFAULT`, this set cannot be exhaustive in
 * either direction; a permanently unremovable tree may also arrive as `EFAULT` and simply
 * costs the full retry budget before it is reported. That is acceptable because both
 * paths end the same way — see `removeTempTree`.

/**
 * Remove a test temp tree, retrying while the OS still holds a handle inside it.
 *
 * A just-exited child process, or the test's own preceding async writes, can leave a
 * handle open for a short window after the work that created it finished. Windows is
 * where this actually bites: an unretried cleanup there fails the test that just passed
 * (#2306).
 *
 * The retry is written out rather than delegated to `rm`'s own `maxRetries`/`retryDelay`
 * because **Bun accepts those options and ignores them**. Measured on Bun 1.3.11: against
 * a tree holding one file locked with the macOS `uchg` flag (unlink returns EPERM, which
 * is in the retry set Node documents), `rm(..., { maxRetries: 10, retryDelay: 50 })`
 * rejects in 0 ms, while the same call on node v25.6.1 retries for ~300 ms and succeeds
 * once the flag clears. `rmSync` behaves the same way. Bun also reports errors it cannot
 * map as `EFAULT` — that same locked-file probe surfaces EPERM as
 * `EFAULT: bad address in system call argument`, which is why cleanup failures on Windows
 * CI carry a code that looks nothing like a lock. Switching back to the built-in options
 * is safe only once Bun actually honors them.
 *
 * Failing to delete a scratch directory is not a test failure, so a tree that never comes
 * free warns instead of throwing — but it does warn, so a genuine leak stays visible. An
 * error outside `TRANSIENT_CODES` takes that same exit immediately rather than retrying
 * against a condition that will not clear. (`force: true` already absorbs "already gone".)

 * Track temp roots for teardown, and register the `afterEach` that removes them.
 *
 * Call once at module scope and pass every root through the returned function as it is
 * created:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const trackTempRoot = trackTempRoots();
 * const root = trackTempRoot(mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), 'fixture-')));
 * ```
 *
 * Registering at creation rather than removing at the end of the test body is the point:
 * a trailing removal runs only when every assertion above it passed, so the tests most
 * worth diagnosing are exactly the ones that leak their fixture. It also keeps the
 * removal off the test's own time budget.
 *
 * The invariant is "every root this file created gets torn down", and it holds only while
 * roots are created through one helper that tracks them. A test that calls `mkdtemp`
 * inline instead leaks silently, so give each file a single creation helper and route
 * every fixture through it.
 *
 * Not for a teardown that has to do something else first — stopping a child process,
 * closing a database — before the tree can be removed. Splitting that into two hooks
 * makes correctness depend on their registration order, which nothing states and a later
 * edit can invert. Keep those files on one explicit `afterEach` that calls
 * `removeTempTree` in the right sequence.
