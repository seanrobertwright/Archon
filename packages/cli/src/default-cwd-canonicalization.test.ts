/**
 * Seam lock for `remote_agent_codebases.default_cwd` (#2927).
 *
 * The column is matched by exact string equality, so it only works while every
 * writer and every reader turns a filesystem path into that string with the
 * SAME function. That invariant used to live in prose — two comments each
 * claiming to "mirror" the other — and it was false: the CLI/HTTP writer used
 * `fs/promises.realpath`, the CLI gate and the chat writer used
 * `fs.realpathSync`, and on Windows those disagree about 8.3 short names
 * (`C:\Users\RUNNER~1\…` vs `C:\Users\runneradmin\…`). Every folder project
 * registered by the CLI became invisible to every later command in that
 * directory, behind a false "Not in a git repository".
 *
 * A behavioural test cannot catch the recurrence on macOS or Linux, where all
 * the realpath variants agree — the second canonicalizer is invisible until it
 * reaches Windows. So this file locks the seam where it is actually visible: a
 * site that resolves a `default_cwd` path may reach `canonicalizeProjectPath`
 * and nothing else. Adding a second canonicalization means importing a realpath,
 * and importing a realpath fails here.
 *
 * @see packages/core/src/handlers/register-folder-lookup.integration.test.ts
 *      for the write-then-read round trip these files have to satisfy.
