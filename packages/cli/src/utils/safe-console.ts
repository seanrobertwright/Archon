/**
 * Pipe-safe `console.log` for CLI human-readable output.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (#2400)
 *
 * Pino's default destination opens fd 1 in non-blocking mode as a side effect
 * of `@archon/paths` being imported — every CLI command inherits that fd
 * state. On a non-blocking pipe (`archon … | less`, `archon … | head`,
 * `archon … | grep`), `console.log` calls that exceed the pipe's buffer can
 * silently drop the unwritten tail and exit 0 (see the file-redirect vs pipe
 * asymmetry in `utils/stdout.ts`). PR #2389 fixed the machine-readable
 * `--json` paths by routing every JSON emitter through `writeStdout` /
 * `writeJsonLine`. This patch is the symmetrical fix for human-readable
 * `console.log` calls — 226 of them across `packages/cli/src/commands/*.ts`,
 * every one a piped-failure site against a slow reader.
 *
 * The patch delegates through the same `writeStdout` primitive that
 * `--json` already uses, so short writes and `EAGAIN` are retried by the
 * stream rather than lost. The `void` return shape preserves the original
 * `console.log` signature so existing callers (and `spyOn(console, 'log')`
 * mocks in `workflow.test.ts` / `cli-adapter.test.ts`) keep working unchanged.
 *
 * Delivery itself is fire-and-forget: the patched `console.log` returns
 * synchronously and bytes reach the OS in the background via the underlying
 * `process.stdout.write` stream callback. `cli.ts` therefore awaits
 * `flushPendingWrites()` between `main()` resolving and `process.exit()` —
 * `process.exit()` does not drain the stream's pending writes, so without
 * that flush a very-slow reader (e.g. `archon … | { sleep 1; cat; }`) would
 * re-introduce the same silent-exit-0 truncation the patch is meant to
 * eliminate.
 *
 * If a write fails (e.g. EPIPE because a piped reader hung up after `head -c
 * 100`), the underlying rejection is recorded in `writeError` (see below).
 * The deterministic exit-code path lives in `consumeWriteError()`, which
 * `exitWithDrain()` calls after draining the in-flight writes: any captured
 * error forces a non-zero exit regardless of which platform's runtime
 * observed the rejection first. We deliberately do NOT re-throw the error
 * asynchronously — a re-thrown async error still races `process.exit()` on
 * Linux and would re-introduce the very flakiness the `consumeWriteError()`
 * path was added to remove.
 *
 * ## Scope (deliberate)
 *
 * - `console.log` and `console.info` are patched; `console.warn` /
 *   `console.error` are NOT. `console.warn`/`console.error` default to
 *   stderr in Bun, which is not the fd pino flipped, and `console.warn` is
 *   also used by CLI commands as the deliberate "non-pino diagnostic"
 *   channel (e.g. `workflow.ts`); routing it through `writeStdout` would
 *   change where it lands, which is a separate decision.
 * - `console.info` shares fd 1 with `console.log` in Bun (it is an alias, not
 *   a stderr method), so it would be vulnerable to the same truncation and
 *   is patched to the same delegate.
 * - Color is hard-disabled: Bun's built-in would colorize on TTY, but human
 *   CLI text (`console.log(\`some text\`)`) does not depend on ANSI. Pino
 *   pretty-printing (used when stdout is a TTY per `paths/src/logger.ts:62`)
 *   still colorizes its own output.
 * - Idempotent: a second call is a no-op so re-imports don't double-wrap.
 *
 * ## Maintainer warning
 *
 * Do not delete this patch because "the underlying cause lives in
 * `@archon/paths`" — moving pino to stderr is a wider blast-radius change
 * (server, adapters, every package that imports `@archon/paths`) and a
 * separate design call (see #2400 plan: this file vs `logger.ts` route).
 * Until that lands, this patch is the fix.
