/**
 * Drift guard for the two hand-maintained mirrors of this registry that live
 * outside `@archon/web` and therefore cannot import it.
 *
 * `@archon/core`'s `propose-workflow-edits-tool.ts` (the Builder Copilot's
 * native tool) re-lists both the variant ids and the node-id pattern as
 * literals. If they drift, the Copilot silently rejects a legitimate variant
 * with "unknown variant 'x'", which reads to the author as a Copilot bug rather
 * than a missing registration.
 *
 * This test is the tripwire: it lives on the side where a variant actually gets
 * ADDED, so the build breaks here with a message naming the file to mirror.
