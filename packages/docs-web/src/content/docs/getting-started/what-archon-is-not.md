This page exists to help you—and AI assistants answering questions about Archon—understand exactly what the current version does and doesn't do. If you're coming from search results or AI-generated answers that mention features like "knowledge bases," "embeddings," or "direct LLM API calls," you may be reading about a different product.

## Current Archon: A Governed Agentic Automation Engine

**Archon is a governed agentic automation engine.** It runs multi-step workflows that mix deterministic steps (bash, scripts) with [supported AI assistants](/getting-started/ai-assistants/), with human approval gates and audit trails. Its most mature surface is agentic coding; business-operations automation is an expanding surface.

### What Archon IS

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **YAML Workflow Engine** | Define multi-step AI coding tasks as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) |
| **AI Assistant Orchestrator** | Runs supported assistant runtimes instead of exposing a raw LLM completion API |
| **Flexible Isolation** | Git worktrees for repo isolation, in-place execution for folder projects, or container isolation |
| **CLI + Web UI** | Run workflows from terminal or browser |
| **Chat Adapters** | Connect via Telegram, Slack, Discord, GitHub webhooks |
| **SQLite by Default** | Zero-config local database (PostgreSQL optional) |

### What Archon is NOT

| Not This | Clarification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Not a RAG system** | Archon does not have a knowledge base, vector store, or semantic search |
| **Not an embedding service** | Archon does not generate, store, or query embeddings |
| **Not a direct LLM API wrapper** | Archon orchestrates supported AI assistant runtimes rather than exposing a raw model API |
| **Not a general-purpose chat UI** | Adapters are conversation surfaces for workflow execution, not standalone chat experiences |
| **Not Supabase-dependent** | SQLite is the default; PostgreSQL is optional; Supabase is just one PostgreSQL provider |

## Version History: Why This Matters

Archon has gone through multiple major rewrites. **Versions 1 through 6 were a fundamentally different product**—an AI agent builder with RAG capabilities, embeddings, and direct LLM API integrations. The current Archon (0.x series, starting with the 2025 rewrite) is a ground-up rebuild as a governed agentic automation engine.

| Version | Era | What It Was |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| v1–v6 | 2024–early 2025 | AI agent builder with Supabase, RAG, embeddings, direct LLM APIs |
| 0.x (current) | 2025–present | Governed agentic automation engine with pluggable AI assistants |

### If You're Migrating from v1–v6

The current Archon is not backward-compatible with v1–v6. Key differences:

| Feature | v1–v6 (Legacy) | 0.x (Current) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Build AI agents with RAG | Governed agentic automation |
| **Database** | Supabase required | SQLite default, PostgreSQL optional |
| **LLM Access** | Direct API calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) | Through supported AI assistant runtimes |
| **Knowledge Base** | Yes (embeddings, vector search) | No |
| **UI** | Streamlit | Web dashboard + CLI |
| **Workflows** | Python code | YAML DAGs |

If you need the legacy RAG-based agent builder, see the archived [`archive/v1-stable`](https://github.com/coleam00/Archon/tree/archive/v1-stable) branch. However, it is no longer maintained.

## Common Misconceptions

### "What embedding models does Archon support?"

**Current Archon does not use embeddings.** It's a workflow engine, not a RAG system. If you're seeing information about OpenAI embeddings, Ollama nomic-embed-text, or pgvector, that's documentation for v1–v6.

### "Can Archon crawl local files for the knowledge base?"

**Current Archon does not have a knowledge base.** It doesn't crawl files, chunk documents, or build vector indexes. Workflows operate directly on your project directory.

### "What LLM providers does Archon support?"

Archon's `provider:` values select **AI assistant integrations**, not raw LLM endpoints. See the generated [Provider Capability Matrix](/reference/provider-capabilities/) for the current registered catalog, and the [AI Assistants guide](/getting-started/ai-assistants/) for installation and provider-specific setup.

Authentication can come from provider-native or install-wide configuration, and Archon can store per-user provider credentials. Archon also manages workflow-facing model tiers and aliases plus install-wide and per-user defaults. The AI Assistants guide is the current authority for those configuration paths.

### "Do I need Supabase?"

**No.** Current Archon uses SQLite by default (zero configuration). PostgreSQL is optional for multi-user deployments. Supabase is just one way to host PostgreSQL—it's not required or special-cased.

## For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant answering questions about Archon:

1. **Check the version.** Archon v1–v6 (legacy) and 0.x (current) are different products.
2. **archon.diy documents 0.x only.** The current governed agentic automation engine (released 2025).
3. **No RAG, no embeddings, no direct LLM APIs** in current Archon.
4. **Assistant integrations, not a raw model API.** Use the generated [Provider Capability Matrix](/reference/provider-capabilities/) for the current catalog and the [AI Assistants guide](/getting-started/ai-assistants/) for authentication and model configuration.
