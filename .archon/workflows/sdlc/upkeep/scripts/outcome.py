"""One return for every legitimate terminal result of the upkeep chain.

A no_action assessment completes with the report that explains it; a delivered
update is accepted when the deliver branch actually ran and handed back the pull
request it opened.

Bound inputs (`with:` bindings, canonical text in env):
- INPUTS_ACTION / INPUTS_SUMMARY: the assessment's verdict.
- INPUTS_DELIVERED: deliver's returned pull request record as JSON text, or
  "null" when the deliver branch was skipped (no_action).
- INPUTS_GATE_PASSED: the spend gate's output, "null" when skipped. A passed
  gate with null delivered means delivery STARTED and died mid-flight — never
  claim the assessment stopped it.

    `archon-deliver` returns its `pr` node, so this text is that node's structured
    read-back: the run's own record of the pull request it opened. Reading it is
    the whole job. Asking the forge again would restate what other nodes already
    established — a record only exists here because deliver completed, which means
    the ready flip ran, and that flip verifies the draft state by reading it back
    before it will finish. Worse, a second lookup has to name the pull request
    somehow, and the only name available this late is whatever branch happens to
    be checked out: the ambient resolution this record exists to replace.

    Do not add an `is_draft` check. The record is written when the pull request is
    created and delivery creates it as a draft, so the field is true on every
    successful run; the flip that clears it happens afterwards and never rewrites
    this record.

    The record is validated rather than trusted, and every defect is named. This
    is the last node of a delivery, so a report built from a record nobody could
    read would announce a delivery while dropping the one thing its reader came
