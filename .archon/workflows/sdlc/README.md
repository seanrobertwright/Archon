# Working in the SDLC pack

Conventions for this pack specifically. Project-wide judgment lives in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); the YAML surface is governed by
[`.archon/workflow-language-constitution.md`](../../workflow-language-constitution.md).

## Guards

A guard here must protect an action the node it lives in takes.

**Keep** a guard when it:

- verifies the effect of something this node just did — exit 0 is not proof, and
  `gh pr ready` can succeed against an already-ready PR without changing anything; or
- refuses to proceed on a question it asked and could not get an answer to, where
  guessing is irreversible. `archon complete` blocking a branch delete it could not
  prove safe is the shape.

**Cut** a guard when it re-asserts an invariant something else already established.
That belongs where it is established, once — not at each node that depends on it.

**The test: if this pack's fixture suite cannot exercise the guard, it is not a
guard. It is a comment — write it as one.**

That test is mechanical and settles most arguments without debating threat models.
A node the dry run cannot execute — a composed `bash:` node, for instance, which
never receives its caller's `with:` values — can only ever be stubbed, so no
fixture can show the guard working or catch it breaking.

### Why this rule exists

The pack once verified "the checkout is on the branch my PR is on" in three places:
a preflight node before review, the ready flip, and prose inside the correction
prompt for an agent to honour. Three copies, two languages, one of them dependent
on a model's diligence.

None of it was load-bearing. The engine gives a run its worktree, and the pull
request is created in that worktree, so the invariant holds by construction.
Nothing had ever gone wrong — the alarm that prompted the work was investigated
and closed invalid. And the copies did not even cover the steps that would have
suffered most from a drifted checkout: `impl` writes code to that checkout without
checking, and `validate` runs the project's tests against it without checking.

The preflight alone cost 31 lines and a stub in 17 fixtures, for a node no fixture
could ever run. All three copies are gone.

What survived in the ready flip is the part that passes the rule: it refuses an
origin remote that does not normalize to `owner/repo`, because its own `gh` calls
would otherwise go somewhere unintended; it refuses to flip while any check is
non-green; and it reads the draft state back afterwards, because a successful
exit is not proof the state changed.

The rule is not "never defend against what has not happened" — the two Keep cases
above have not happened either, and both are worth their few lines. The question is
whether the guard is protecting *this node's own action*, or restating something
that was already true when the node started.

## Evidence never carries credentials

The engine retains what every exec node prints, so a node's output is the record
whether it set out to keep one or not. Never print a value that can contain a
secret: read it where it is normalized and pass on the normalized form. A remote
URL is the common one — `https://<token>@host/repo` is a perfectly ordinary origin
— so the ready flip normalizes `owner/repo` inside the substitution that reads the
remote, and only that reaches a command line. Failure messages are the same
surface: interpolating the raw value into one leaks it just as effectively.

That retention is also why a node does not need its own log. The ready flip once
wrote one by hand — every command it ran, echoed into an artifact — which is what
the transcript now holds for free.

## A node's streams are the operator's channel

Retention is not the only reader. Anything a node writes to stderr is sent to the
operator as the run happens, even when the node succeeds — and that copy is not
redacted. So a node speaks for itself: capture what the commands inside it print,
and let only your own authored messages reach the streams. Re-emit a command's
output when it failed and its words are the diagnostic; drop it when it is just a
tool narrating itself. Capture a value's stderr separately rather than merging it,
too — a `gh` update notice merged into a read becomes the value.
