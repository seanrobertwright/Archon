"""Classify the current branch PR's check state, once.

Archon-owned facts only (gh state, never the project's toolchain). This is the
single-shot probe inside the `await-checks` loop_group: the engine's durable
`wait:` node owns the time between probes, so this script never sleeps
through CI — it reads the state, declares it, and exits.

States, on stdout as JSON so `when:`/`until_bash` can branch without prose:
  {"state": "pending", "detail": ...}    checks exist and some are still running
  {"state": "concluded", "detail": ...}  green, no CI configured, or CI gated on
                                         a maintainer's approval (fork or first
                                         contribution) — a gate only a
                                         maintainer can open, named, never
                                         blocked on and never called green
Red exits 1 with the failing names and the recovery: `pass` counts, `skipping` is
accepted as non-blocking (and named), everything else — `fail`, `cancel`, or any
bucket this script does not recognize — fails the node. A cancelled check is not a
green check (R4). Nothing here retries: a concluded check does not re-run itself,
so the operator re-runs it and resumes, and the resumed probe reads the state again.

The one in-process wait left: when CI is configured but nothing has started
yet, registration gets a single 60 s grace before the maintainer-gated skip is
declared — the same grace the polling predecessor gave it.
