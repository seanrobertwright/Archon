"""The green gate: run success never certifies green — this does, deterministically.

The delivery tail asks the question three times, and the same script answers it each
time: after the implementation, after each correction, and after the project's own
full gate runs post-review. A node that produced a verdict is not a node that passed;
the loop completes on `done`, blocked declines included, so no spend and no public
step happens until this reads the verdict itself.

Red is not one thing, though, and treating it as one killed two correct deliveries.

A change that breaks a check must never reach a pull request. A check that
was already red at the run's starting commit, or that failed because a parallel
process held the database this run needed, is not evidence about the change at all —
and reality gets checked again downstream regardless: flip-ready refuses to make the
PR ready while its real CI is not green. So this fails on `introduced` and lets
`inherited` and `environment` through with the claim recorded where every downstream
reader meets it. An inherited base break stays red on the PR too, and holds at the
durable CI wait, which is the honest place to hold it.

That trade is only safe while it stays loud, so a passed red is never silent: the
record below is what the terminal report and the pull request body repeat. A record
that cannot be written fails the gate — passing red work with no trace of why is the
one outcome worse than refusing.

`red_cause` is agent judgment. This validates the resolved value and nothing else;
the evidence behind it belongs to the declaring node's prompt and its report.

Bound inputs (`with:` bindings, canonical text in env):
- INPUTS_GREEN: the declaring node's verdict, canonical boolean text.
- INPUTS_RED_CAUSE: `introduced`, `inherited`, `environment`, or '' when the
  declared-optional field is absent.
- INPUTS_SUMMARY: that node's summary, which carries the evidence for the claim.
- INPUTS_STAGE: which gate this is, for the record a human reads later.
