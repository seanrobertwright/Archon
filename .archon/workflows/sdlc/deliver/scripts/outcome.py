    A read or parse failure degrades to a one-line pointer at the file rather than
    to silence — the report's reader is exactly who needs to know it is there.
    Nothing is appended only when there is genuinely nothing to report: no sidecar,
    or no recorded discoveries. `title` is coerced rather than trusted: an agent
    writes these records from prose with no schema, and a JSON-legal non-string
    title must not raise past the caller and fail an already-delivered run.

    A FAILED run with no consolidated file never reached review, so the producers' own
    sidecars are the entire record — format_raw_discoveries owns that case. An
    EMPTY consolidated file is review's adjudication rather than a gap, so it stays
    silent, and a completed run's report keeps the same shape on every branch.
