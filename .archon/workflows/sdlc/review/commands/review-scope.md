# Review Scope

Establish exactly what this review round examines, and write it down for the reviewer or reviewers that follow. You do not judge anything; you make the target precise.

## Inputs

**Requested scope** (may be empty):

$INPUTS.scope

**Previous round's report** (path; empty means this is the first round, full review):

$INPUTS.prior_report

**Accepted work order** (may be empty for a standalone review):

$INPUTS.work_order

The run's trigger message, which may narrow or override the above:

$ARGUMENTS

## Resolve the target

- When the requested scope is a bare PR number, delivery recorded it — review exactly that PR. Derive the normalized `owner/repo` from `origin` without writing its raw URL into an artifact, and use `gh ... --repo <owner/repo>` with that number for every GitHub read. Do not resolve a PR from the current branch, and do not accept a different target. The review object is that PR's diff, exactly.
- A PR number, URL, or branch → resolve it with `gh pr view` (title, body, base, head, state, files) and `gh pr diff`. Make sure the PR's head is what the local checkout reflects; note the head SHA. **In PR mode the review object is the PR's diff, exactly — uncommitted or untracked local state is out of scope and must not appear in the scope file.**
- Empty scope → first check whether the current branch has an open PR (`gh pr view`); if it does, that PR is the target (PR mode, as above). Otherwise the working diff: uncommitted changes plus commits ahead of the merge-base with the default/base branch (`git merge-base`, `git diff`, `git log`). Note the current HEAD SHA.

## Resolve the accepted contract

- When `work_order` is non-empty, read it in full. It is the accepted contract implementation received. Preserve its required outcome, explicit non-goals, and boundaries as prose; do not parse it with scripts, regexes, or keyword extraction.
- When `work_order` is empty and the target is a PR, use the PR body's problem/outcome and explicit scope or non-goals as the standalone review contract. Do not infer a broader promise from the changed files.
- When neither supplies an explicit boundary, state that the review is using the requested scope and repository contracts without inventing a non-goal.

## Select docs review

Set `docs` true when the reviewed diff changes shipped documentation, unless the
diff is small, mechanical, and likely-correct — a version bump, a one-line fix, a
rename, a test-only tweak — in which case a doc-adjacent touch alone does not
earn the lens. Otherwise set it false. This selection applies only when the
workflow's `docs` input is `auto`; an explicit input overrides it.

## Light mode (a prior report exists)

When a prior-report path is supplied, require that it exists and read it in full. A missing supplied report is a broken continuation contract: fail with the path named instead of silently starting a full review. Extract its **reviewed-head cursor** (the SHA it records). For a PR target, this round's diff is **only the delta**: `git diff <cursor>..HEAD`. For a working-diff target, include that delta plus any uncommitted changes. The prior report remains the sole owner of earlier findings and review coverage; do not copy or rebuild them in scope.md.

## Write the scope file

Write `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/review/scope.md` containing:

1. **Accepted contract** — the required outcome, followed by explicit non-goals or boundaries. State the source: supplied work order, PR body, or requested scope/repository contracts.
2. **Target** — PR reference or "working diff", base branch, and the **head SHA under review** (this becomes the next round's cursor).
3. **Mode** — full review, or light (delta since `<cursor>`).
4. **Changed files** — path list with a one-line shape of the change per file (added/modified/deleted, rough size).
5. **The diff to review** — inline when small; for a large diff, the exact commands a reviewer runs to see it (`git diff <range>`, `gh pr diff <n>`).
6. **Prior report** — continuation mode only: its path and reviewed-head cursor. Do not duplicate its findings or coverage.

## Verify before finishing

Confirm `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/review/scope.md` exists, names the accepted contract and head SHA, and that the diff commands in it actually produce output in this checkout. Return `docs` as the boolean selected above.
