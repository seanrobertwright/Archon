# Simplify Review — The Smallest Coherent Shape

Writing code is cheap; maintaining it and recovering option value are not. Hunt one defect: **the change delivers its required outcome through more structure than that outcome needs.** Preserve meaningful invariants, supported behavior, and useful foundations — not accidental implementation shape. Read-only: never modify files, commit, or post anywhere.

Read `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/review/scope.md` first, and the project's `architecture.md` if it has one. Anchor the review on the accepted work order's stated invariants, and scale depth to what the change can destroy: irreversible or destructive paths, lifecycle ownership, persisted contracts and schemas, credentials and auth boundaries, integration boundaries, and concurrency over shared state each get an explicit attempt to refute the invariant they rest on; a prose-only change gets the minimum. In light mode, verify prior simplify findings first, then examine only the delta.

## Establish the contract

Start with the exact diff scope.md records, against its base. Establish the intended outcome and invariants from the accepted work order, the PR, the changed files, their tests, and direct consumers. Read beyond the diff only as far as settling a concrete question requires. Existing code is evidence, not a mandate.

## Test the structural decisions

Look first for decisions that add coordination or prematurely close options:

- **Data shape and ownership:** Do core types match the dominant access paths? Is data copied, flattened, rebuilt, cached, or represented more than once when one owner could carry it?
- **Coherent capability:** Does the change deepen one useful abstraction, or spread special-case coordination across callers, layers, and schemas?
- **Concurrency:** If another actor changes shared state concurrently, is the answer safely "nothing"? If not, should the state be isolated instead of synchronized?
- **Foundations:** Would one smaller primitive make the downstream logic obvious? Remove dead weight before adding scaffold; add scaffold early only when every later phase benefits from it.
- **Premature machinery:** Which real supported variation requires each new state, lifecycle, wrapper, configuration surface, fallback, or extension point?

Apply the laziness test:

- Prefer deletion and direct control flow before introducing helpers or abstractions.
- Keep call paths flat enough that ownership and decisions remain easy to trace. A rich interface that hides substantial work is not itself a deep call chain.
- Consolidate each decision behind one source of truth and pass the resolved result plainly.
- Question new signals threaded through types, schemas, pipelines, or layers; look for the owner or primitive that already knows the answer.
- Catch small pass-throughs, representation leaks, and duplicated choices before they become lasting coordination costs.
- DRY shared structure and data models, not every repeated line. Explicit repetition can be simpler than a premature abstraction.

Line count is not the invariant. Fewer states, representations, concepts, synchronization points, branches, and ownership boundaries are. If the result would exhaust a human maintainer, reconsider it.

## Require proof

Report a simplification only when the evidence establishes:

- the required outcome and invariant;
- the avoidable machinery and its concrete maintenance or correctness cost;
- an existing or smaller primitive that carries the same behavior; and
- callers, tests, contracts, or focused validation that support the replacement.

Try to falsify the smaller shape against concurrency, ordering, persistence, compatibility, and error semantics where relevant. Do not replace explicit code with clever code, move complexity into a helper, invent a new abstraction for hypothetical reuse, or broaden the review into unrelated cleanup. A wrong outcome is the code lens's finding, an unprotected behavior the tests lens's, and a missing type at a boundary the seams lens's — report the structure, and let the synthesizer merge what overlaps.

When execution is practical, run the smallest command that can falsify a replacement. Invoke it the way this repository documents its own commands — the package scripts and invocation rules its steering files name, never an ad-hoc variant one of them warns against.

## Severity

- **Important** — a concrete, behavior-preserving smaller shape carrying the proof above. Simplification found at review is corrected on the produced change, not deferred: merged complexity compounds into drift that every later change pays for, and a verdict may rest on simplification alone.
- **Suggestion** — the smaller shape is speculative, or the replacement risks behavior you could not falsify. Non-blocking; name the evidence that would raise it.

This lens has no Critical: a smaller shape is never itself an emergency, and machinery that is actually incorrect belongs to the code lens.

## Output

Write `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/review/simplify.md`: each in-scope finding begins with `sources: [simplify]`, followed by severity, the proof fields above with `file:line` references, the smaller shape, what disappears, and any real tradeoff. Then the examined-and-clean list naming the decisive primitives, invariants, or supported variations that justify the structure you left alone. In light mode, a verdict per prior finding. If nothing meaningful can disappear, say so briefly and name what you checked — never claim the change is optimal.

If you prove useful work outside scope.md's accepted contract, do not turn it into a blocking finding. Write `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/discoveries/review-simplify.json` as a JSON array of records with `title`, `claim`, `evidence` (concrete `file:line` facts or command results), `relation` (`adjacent` or `scope_conflict`), and `source_node` (`simplify`). Write no file for no discovery; never append to another lens's file or record suspicion.

Verify every cited `file:line` is real, then reply with one line pointing to it: `review findings: $ARTIFACTS_DIR/review/simplify.md` and the findings count by severity.
