/**
 * Repository-level parity checks: the web UI's copies of two engine grammars —
 * the `$<nodeId>.output` reference and the `when:` comparison atom — must stay
 * identical to the engine's originals.
 *
 * `@archon/web` must never import `@archon/workflows` (a server package), and
 * `api.generated.d.ts` is type-only so it cannot carry a runtime value — the
 * same constraint AGENTS.md records for `TRIGGER_RULES`. The web package
 * therefore keeps deliberate copies of both grammars, and these checks are what
 * keep those copies honest.
 *
 * They live in `scripts/` rather than beside the web modules because this is a
 * cross-package repository invariant, not a unit of `@archon/web` behavior — the
 * same reason the bundled-defaults and capability-matrix checks live here. Every
 * file is read as TEXT, so no package boundary is crossed. `bun run test` ends
 * with `bun test ./scripts/`, so CI enforces it.
 *
 * The drift this catches actually happened: the builder's legacy copy used
 * `\w`, which excludes the hyphen, so it silently validated none of the
 * hyphenated node ids the bundled workflows use (#2567).

/**
 * A regex over raw source cannot tell a DECLARATION from a MENTION of one. That
 * is the whole difficulty here, and every layer below is about narrowing the gap
 * — none of them closes it, so treat this as "cheap steps toward reading code",
 * not as a solved problem.
 *
 * The failure mode is concrete: a commented-out copy holding the CURRENT value,
 * sitting above a live constant that has genuinely drifted. That is an ordinary
 * thing to find in a file someone is mid-refactor on, and it makes the whole
 * suite pass while the invariant is broken. Measured against the real test file,
 * each row with the #2567 regression (a dropped hyphen in `NODE_ID_SOURCE`) live:
 *
 *   extractor                  `// …`      `/*` indented   `/*` at column 0
 *   no anchor                  DEFEATED    DEFEATED        DEFEATED
 *   `^\s*(?:export )?const`    caught      DEFEATED        DEFEATED
 *   `^(?:export )?const`       caught      caught          DEFEATED
 *   + strip comments first     caught      caught          caught
 *
 * Hence both layers, which are complementary rather than redundant: stripping
 * removes commented-out copies whatever their indentation, and the column-0
 * anchor still rejects a mention embedded mid-line in live code, which stripping
 * leaves untouched.
 *
 * Column 0 is safe rather than brittle: all six constants this file extracts are
 * top-level, and an indented one would not be. If a future constant is nested,
 * widen deliberately and re-run the decoy matrix — do not reach for `\s*`.
 *
 * A guard that can be silently defeated is worse than no guard: it buys
 * confidence in exactly the invariant it is failing to check.
