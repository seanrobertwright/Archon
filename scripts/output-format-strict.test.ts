/**
 * Repository-level schema check: every `output_format` a bundled workflow declares
 * must satisfy OpenAI Structured Outputs strict mode.
 *
 * Strict mode has two rules. The Codex provider injects the first one for the author
 * (`additionalProperties: false`, see `normalizeJsonSchemaForOpenAiStrict`). It
 * deliberately does NOT inject the second — every key in `properties` must also
 * appear in `required` — because doing so would silently turn an optional field into
 * a required one and change what the model is asked for (#1843). That leaves the rule
 * with no enforcement anywhere, and a schema that violates it is accepted by every
 * local check and then rejected by the API at the first turn:
 *
 *     invalid_json_schema: 'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array
 *     including every key in properties. Missing 'red_cause'.  (400, run 3bb361e3)
 *
 * That is the bug this file exists to stop repeating. It shipped in #2942: a
 * `red_cause` property was declared optional by omission from `required`, every
 * fixture stayed green — dry runs contact no provider — and every archon-deliver run
 * on a Codex config then died at implement's first turn, before doing any work.
 *
 * The check is on the AUTHORED yaml rather than on a provider payload, because that
 * is where the rule can be satisfied at all: optionality has to be expressed inside
 * the type (an enum carrying the absent form, or a `["string","null"]` union), not by
 * omission from `required`.
 *
 * A workflow that pins `provider:` is exempt. Optional-by-omission is a real engine
 * feature — a declared-optional field that is absent resolves to `''` rather than
 * throwing — and a workflow that names its provider has chosen one that accepts it.
 * A workflow with no pin runs on whatever the operator configured, so it must hold
 * to the strictest provider in the bundle.
